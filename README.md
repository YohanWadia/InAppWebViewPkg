# InAppWebViewPkg

Made this because we needed to take the InAppWebViews package... make an entire app with the webview inside... and then load it on a web server to see if it works.

this is because the index.html page needs some manupilation.
so the regular in Chrome execution from Android Studio doesnt compile with that change
so after you run a flutter build web.. you then edit the index.html @ build/web folder... and then load the entire thing as a site.
YOu cant run an index.html by clicking on it on the computers folder cause it needs a web servers environment.
